# Extended File Support for Obsidian

This plugin aims to add viewing and embedding support for various file types in Obsidian. 
It does *not* aim to allow these files to be edited. 
This is considered to be outside of the scope of this plugin.

File types can be toggled in the settings.

# Currently Supported

The file types that are currently supported are:

- `.kra` (Files made in Krita)
-

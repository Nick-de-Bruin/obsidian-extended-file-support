# Extended File Support for Obsidian

This plugin aims to add viewing and embedding support for various file types in Obsidian. 
It does *not* aim to allow these files to be edited. 
This is considered to be outside of the scope of this plugin.

File types can be toggled in the settings.

# Currently Supported

The file types that are currently supported are:

- `.kra` (Files made in Krita)
- `.psd` (Photoshop, other visual programs)
- `.ai` (Adobe Illustrator)
- `.gltf`, `.glb` (3D scene format)
- `.obj` (3D object format)
- `.stl` (3D format, often used for 3d printing)
